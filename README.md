# Class COVID-19 Model
*This was created to model the spread of COVID in a classroom using CDC protocols*
This model was created for a newspaper article that was ultimately shelved. 
## What the Colors Mean
- Light Blue means a student/teacher has COVID.
- Red means a student/teacher is within 6 feet of an infected person meaning that they would have to quarantine under CDC protocols.
- Yellow/Green means a student/teacher is not within 6 feet of an infected person and is also not infected with COVID.
## What Clicking the Desks Do
- **Empty Desk:** Fills a desk with a healthy student.
- **Desk with Yellow/Red Student:** Turns healthy student into one infected with COVID.
- **Desk with Light Blue Student:** Turns desk into empty desk. 
## What the Buttons Do:
- **Add All Students:** Fills every desk with a student.
- **Remove All Students:** Clears all desks of students.
- **Generate Class of *x* Students:** Fills *x* desks with students.  
- **Find Best Arrangement:** Finds the best possible arrangement of students to reduce the spread of COVID within the classroom. It determines this by number of quarantines per COVID case. It then returnss the arrangement.
